# OIC Explorer

A cross-platform, mobile-first tool to discover and explore OIC devices on the local network.

This project is built upon [Xamarin.Forms](https://www.xamarin.com/forms), [ReactiveUI](https://reactiveui.net/) and uses [OICNet](https://github.com/NZSmartie/OICNet) with [CoAPNet](https://github.com/NZSmartie/CoAP.Net).

## Status

So it looks terrible, and doesn't do a whole lot yet. But it's a work in progress that will hopefully be really useful for debugging IoT devices that take advantage of OIC.

## Target Platforms

 - Universal Windows Platform (UWP) 
 - Android. 

Since I don't own any Apple devices, I'm unable to build or test for iOS (Sorry, contact me if you want to dontate hardware!).
