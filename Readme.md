# CoapTest

A tool to discover and explore CoAP devices on the network.

This project is experimental as I'm learning how to use Xamarin.Forms, and my (CoAP.Net)[/NZSmartie/CoAP.Net] library.
So it looks terrible, and doesn't do a whole lot (Not yet anyway).

This project targets Universal Windows Platform (UWP) and Android. Since I don't own any Apple devices, I'm unable to build or test for iOS (Sorry).
